# Focus on the good parts of writing your commit

- Do you use conventional commits in your daily workflow?
- Do you specify the scope(s) every time for the packages you're working on?

If so this project might save you some time. It provides you with a [git prepare-commit-msg hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) that figures out the repetitive parts of your commit for you.
